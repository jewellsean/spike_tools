Median decay rate, GCaMP6f:
decay_rate = 0.9704588

Median decay rate, GCaMP6m:
decay_rate = 0.9843887

Note that these median decay rates are used for spike estimates on in vivo data of VTA DA neurons at 60 Hz.
It is recommended that the sampling rate is adjusted to 60 Hz in the data preprocessing step prior to spike estimation.
If estimating spikes at a final sampling rate other than 60 Hz, the decay rate can be adjusted:

adj_decay_rate = 1 - (60/fps_new) * (1 - decay_rate)

where fps_new is the desired sampling rate in Hz, and decay_rate is one of the original decay rates above.
